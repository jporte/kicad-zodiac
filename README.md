# KiCad zodiac footprints - WIP

Because I like little Easter Eggs on PCBs, I created these footprints.
The idea is to place the constellations that were in the ecliptic while I was working on the project.

The choice fell on constellations because I find that they can be wonderfully implemented on a circuit board.

These footprints fit in a ten by ten millimeter square.
There are two versions of each constellatiopn. A \_copper and a \_silkscreen one. The difference should be self-explanatory.

| Constellation | \_copper                                          | \_silkscreen                                              |
